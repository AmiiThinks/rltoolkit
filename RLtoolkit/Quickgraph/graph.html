<h1>Graph.py: A Quick-Graphing Tool for Python
</h1>
<p> by <a href="sutton.html">Richard S. Sutton</a> <br>
and Steph Schaeffer </p>
<p><a name="graph"></a>
This is a tool to enable users of Python to quickly graph lists of
numbers. For example,
if <code><i>data</i></code> is a list of numbers, then <code>graph(<i>data</i>)</code>
will create a window
with a graph of the numbers, appropriately scaled.&nbsp; Alternatively,
the
data can be a list of (x, y) or [x, y] coordinates, e.g., [[x1, y1],
[x2, y2] ...]. If you
have several lists to be plotted on the same graph, you just
make a list of them and graph that.</p>
<p>Graph is based on the graphics package <a href="g.html">G</a>.&nbsp;
G and graph both rely on tk; you must have
tk on your machine, and the Pyhton module Tkinter. You must also be
running in a windowing environment. Note that you must execute the g
command <code>gMainloop()</code>
(to start window event processing) before you will
actually see the
window. The window will appear behind your currently running
application; you may need to move your window and click on the graph
window to see it properly.

Now with <a href="#histograms">histograms</a> as well.
<hr>
<h2>Simple Examples</h2>
<pre>graph([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])                              #Graphs the numbers, as heights<br><br>graph([sin(x/10.0) for x in range(200)])               #Graphs (sin x); see figure below<br><br>graph([[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3]])                  #Graphs line by x,y coordinates<br><br>graph([x/100.0, sin(x/100.0)] for x in range(314)])    #Detailed graph of (sin x)<br><br>graph([[sin(x) for x in range(0,20)], \                #Graphs (sin x) and cos(x)<br>       [cos(x) for x in range(0,20)]])                 #as 2 lines on the same graph<br></pre>
The second example above, for example, produces:
<p><img src="sin.jpg" alt="sin.jpg" height="217" width="515"></p>
<h2>Multiple Graphs</h2>
<a name="multiple graphs"></a>
<p>All of the above create a new graph window to hold the graph, or
take over the
first existing graph window if there is one. If you wish to use
multiple graphs, you need to give them names in the forms of strings
that are the titles of the graph's windows. The name-strings are an
additional argument to graph, as in these examples:
</p>
<pre>graph([sin(x) for x in range(20)], None, "Sine")             ; new graph window<br><br>graph(cos(x) for x in range(20)], None, "Cosine")            ; 2nd graph window<br><br>graph(sin(x) for x in frange(0, 3.14, .01)], None, "Sine")   ; replace first sin graph<br></pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Controlling Line Colors</h2>
<a name="Controlling line colors"></a>
<p>Each line plotted on the graph will normally be a different color,
chosen by some default way to be different from the other colors.
If you want a line to be a particular color, you indicate this by a
second argument to graph, as in:
</p>
<pre>graph([sin(x) for x in range(20)], "red")                    ; red sin line<br><br>graphMore([cos(x) for x in range(20), "blue")                ; second blue line on same graph<br></pre>
Allowed values for the color argument are: "blue",
"red",
"green",
"black",
"yellow",
"pink",
"cyan",
"purple",
"magenta",
"orange",
"brown",
"lightBlue",
"gray",
"darkGreen",
"tan",
"white",
"lightGray",
"darkGray". In addition to keywords, one can also use Macintosh color
codes here, such as those
produced by the color routines of the <a href="G/g.html">G</a>
graphics package. When specifying a color,
a graph name can still be used, as a third argument, as in
<pre>graphMore([sin(x) for x in range(20)], "red", "My Graph")    ; red sin line<br></pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Adding to an Existing Graph</h2>
<a name="Adding to an Existing Graph"></a>
<p>You can add a line to an existing graph by using graphMore instead
of graph, as in the last two examples.
</p>
<hr><a name="histograms"></a>
<h2>Histograms</h2>
You can make simple histograms of data by calling <tt>histogram(list-of-data)</tt>.
This produces a graph depicting the distribution of numbers in the data
list. For example, <tt>histogram([randrange(10) for i in range(100)])</tt>
produces:
<p><img src="histogram.jpg" alt="histogram.jpg" height="226" width="479"></p>
<p>Additional histograms can be added to a graph by calling <tt>histogramMore</tt>.
Both routines take arguments:
</p>
<pre>data       a list of data to make the histogram with<br>numbins    number of bins/intervals to use in the histogram<br>minex      minimum value of data included in the histogram<br>maxex      maximum value - only data strictly less than this will be included<br>color      a color to use for the histogram line, as in graph<br>graph      a string indicating which graph to use, as in graph<br></pre>
Thus, a more complete call to generate the above graph would be <br>
<tt>histogram([randrange(10) for i in range(100)], 10, 0, 10, "red",
"Histogram")</tt>.<br>
<i>Minex</i> and <i>maxex</i> default to include all the data. <i>Numbins</i>
defaults to 30 or, in the case of integer data, to the integer span of
the data, if the span is less than 200.
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#histogram">source code</a>]</div>
<hr>
<h2>Controlling Graph Limits and Scaling</h2>
The range of the graph is initially set to just cover the data.
Alternatively, you can manually set the upper and lower limits of the
graph's
data space by calling
<a name="xGraphLimits"></a>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#xGraphLimits">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>xGraphLimits</b>(<i>xmin, xmax,</i> <i>graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<a name="yGraphLimits"></a>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#yGraphLimits">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>yGraphLimits</b>(<i>ymin, ymax,</i> <i>graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<p>Sets the corresponding axis's limits and thus scales the data.
If the min or max argument is None, then it is unchanged. If both are
None, or absent, then the graph returns to automatic scaling. The last
argument, <i>graphTitle</i>, specifies the graph involved, defaulting
to the first graph as always.
</p>
<p>Of course you can also change the scaling by grabbing the grow box
of your graph
and changing the size of the window.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Controlling Tick Marks</h2>
By default graphs have tick marks at just the min and max of their x
and y
axes. Alternatively, you can manually set them by calling
<a name="xTickmarks"></a>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#xTickmarks">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>xTickmarks</b>(<i>tickmarks, graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<a name="yTickmarks"></a>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#yTickmarks">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>yTickmarks</b>(<i>tickmarks, graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<p>Tickmarks can either be a list of actual tickmarks desired, or a
number indicating the distance desired between tickmarks. <i>GraphTitle</i>
specifies the graph involved, defaulting to the first graph as always.
</p>
<p>For example, yTickmarks([0, .5, 1]) puts y-axis tick marks at 0, .5
and 1. yTickmarks(0.5) put y-axis tick marks on every half. You can get
even more control by specifying the text labels for the tick marks,
e.g., by yTickmarks([[0, "0.0"], [.5, "0.5"], [1, "1.0"]]) or <br>
xTickmarks([[0, 'Up'], [1, 'Right'], [2, 'Down'], [3, Left']]). If no
tick marks
are specified, then the axis returns to automated tick-marking (just
the min and max).
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Adding and Removing Lines of Existing Graphs</h2>
<a name="graphMore"></a>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#graphMore">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>graphMore</b>(<i>data</i>, <i>color</i>, <i>graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<p>Plots additional lines, showing <i>data</i>, in the color indicated
(if specified), on the first graph, or the graph indicated
by <i>graphTitle</i>. The graph is rescaled if necessary to accomodate
the new data.
</p>
<p><a name="graphLess"></a>
</p>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#graphLess">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>graphLess</b>(<i>color</i>, <i>graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<p>Removes a line of data from the first graph, or the graph indicated
by <i>graphTitle</i>. The line removed is given by <i>color</i>,
e.g., "red", etc., as given above.
</p>
<p><a name="subtractFromGraph"></a>
</p>
<div align="right">[<a href="graph.py.html#subtractFromGraph">function</a>]</div>
<tt><b>subtractFromGraph</b>(<i>linenumber</i>, <i>graphTitle</i>)</tt>
<p>Removes a line of data from the first graph, or the graph indicated
by <i>graphTitle</i>. The line removed is given by linenumber,
counting from 0, in the order the lines were added to the
graph. If you remove line 0, all the others are of course renumbered so
that they start at 0 again.
</p>

<h2>Printing, Viewing, Miscellaneous </h2>
<p>Use command key sequences for your particular platform to grab the
appropriate portion of the screen and print it or put it in a file for
later printing. For example, on the Mac, command-shift-4 saves a
portion of the screen (which you highlight) into a pdf file.<br>
</p>
<p>Here are some tricks to ease examination of the contents of a graph.
First select the graph and then hit the space-bar. The first line of
the graph is highlighted. The left-right arrow keys move the
highlighting from one line
to the other in sequence, so each can be easily picked out from the
others.
Hitting the space-bar again turns off highlighting. </p>
<p>Move the cursor over the
data space of a selected graph and it turns into a cross-hair. If you
now
click, the precise coordinates of the clicked point are printed
to the shell window.
<a name="gridGraph"></a></p>
<p>The function <code><a href="graph.py.html#gridGraph">gridGraph</a></code>
lays a grid of dotted lines out from each tick
mark, horizontally and vertically. A first optional argument specifies
the <em>density</em> of the dots (by default it is 5, meaning every
fifth pixel is dark).
A second optional argument specifies the graph in the usual way
with a <i>graphTitle</i>.
<a name="chooseGraph"></a></p>
<p>You can access the default graph window in the same way as the
graphing routines do internally by calling <code><a
 href="graph.py.html#chooseGraph">chooseGraph</a>(graphTitle)</code>.
<a name="nthColor"></a></p>
<p>The default color of the <i>n</i>th line on a graph is determined
by the internal function <code><a href="graph.py.html#nthColor">nthColor</a>(n)</code>.
The current implementation returns the colors blue, red, green, black,
yellow, pink,
cyan, purple, magenta, orange, brown, lightBlue, gray, darkGreen, tan,
white, lightGray, and darkGray,
in that order starting from 0. You can change this simply by redefining
<code>nthColor</code>. See the color specification routines in <a
 href="G/G.html">G</a> for how to specify and construct colors.
</p>
<h2>Obtaining and Installing Graph.py</h2>
Graph.py is built on the <a href="g.html">g</a> graphics language
which is in turn built on Tkinter (the Python version of tk).
To install graph, you need to obtain the quickgraph file from the <a
 href="RLtoolkit1.0.html">RLtoolkit page</a>. This contains g, graph,
and graph3d. (You will also need the tkinter module that came
with Python).<br>
<br>
Once
you have the files, here is the normal usage procedure (starting Python
from within the directory you put graph in):
<blockquote>
  <pre>from graph import *<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Graph will automatically import G which imports tkinter (make sure that
you also have g installed).<br>
<br>
If you installed <a href="RLAIUtilities.html">quickgraph</a> as a
Python package, you can run Python from anywhere and import graph with:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>from quickgraph import *<br></pre>
</blockquote>
If you installed the <a href="RLtoolkit.html">RL Toolkit package</a>,
you can run Python from anywhere and import graph with:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>from RLtoolkit.graph import *<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Note that you must execute the g command <code>gMainloop()</code>
before your graph
window will show up.<br>
