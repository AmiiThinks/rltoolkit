    <h2> Introduction </h2>
Here we describe code in C++ and LISP implementing the core part of the
idea of <a
 href="http://richsutton.com/book/8/node6.html#SECTION00132000000000000000">
tile coding with hashing</a>. Tile coding is a way of representing the
values of
a vector of continuous variables as a large binary vector with few 1s
and many 0s.
The binary vector is not represented explicitly of course, but as a
list of the components that are 1s. The main step is to partition, or
tile, the continuous space multiple times and select one tile from each
tiling, that corresponding the the vector's value.
Each tile is converted (hashed down to) an element in the big binary
vector, and the list of
the tile (element) numbers is returned as the representation of the
vector's value. Information and examples of tile coding and its use in
function
approximation and reinforcement learning are given in <a
 href="http://richsutton.com/book/8/node6.html#SECTION00132000000000000000">
Section 8.3.2</a> of our <a
 href="http://richsutton.com/book/the-book.html">RL
book</a>.
    <p>Tile coding is the key distinguishing computational idea behind
CMACs. Implementations of complete CMACs are available from the folks
at the University New Hampshire <a
 href="http://www.ece.unh.edu/robots/cmac.htm">here</a>.
Their package is more suited to straight, bundled CMAC use. Here we
separate tile coding from full CMACs, which allows it to be more
flexibly used, e.g., with eligibility traces. The current software is
also simplified
and streamlined consistent with its use in reinforcement learning
applications.
For example, our code is only a few pages in length and there is just
one routine to call. In its normal use that routine has no memory and
requires no special setup or data types. </p>
    <p>This version 2.0 of the tiling software provides an alternate
version of the main routine that is "safe" in that
it corrects for all hashing collisions, so as to exactly simulate
infinite tillings
(until it runs out of memory). This version can also be used to gather
statistics on hashing collisions even if they are be ignored (as in the
standard version).
The alternate version requires that an additional hashing table be
passed in, and there is greater computational expense. </p>
    <p>Next we describe the use of the tile coding routine. This
description applies to both the C and LISP implementations except that
some of the data handling is a little
simpler in LISP. Mostly we assume we are talking about C; the
simplifications for
LISP users are summarized <a href="#Lisp%20Versions">here</a>.
The C++ code assumes the existence of a function "rand()" that produces
successive psuedorandom integers, of which only the low-order bytes are
used. </p>
    <hr><a name="GetTiles"></a>
    <h2><nop>GetTiles </nop></h2>
    <p>The tile coding software provides a single routine, "<code>GetTiles</code>":
    </p>
    <pre><code><br>void GetTiles(<br>    int tiles[],           // provided array will contain the returned tile indices<br>    int num_tilings,       // number of tile indices to be returned<br>    int memory_size,       // total number of possible tiles<br>    float floats[],        // array of floating-point vars to be converted to tiles<br>    int num_floats,        // number of floating-point variables<br>    int ints[],            // array of integer variables to be converted to tiles<br>    int num_ints)          // number of integer variables<br></code></pre>
    <p>The overall idea here is as follows. The first argument (<code>tiles</code>)
is the output of the routine. This array is provided by the caller and
filled up by <code>GetTiles</code> with tile indices (integers in [0,<code>memory_size</code>)).
The second argument is the number of tile indices returned, so the
provided
array had better be of at least this length. It is recommended by
the folks at UNH (who designed the key algorithm here) that <code>num_tilings</code>
be a power of two. </p>
    <p>Next, <code>memory_size</code> specifies the largest permitted
tile
index.
The next two arguments are the primary
inputs to <code>GetTiles</code>. They specify the floating-point
variables which are to be tiled, in an array with an accompanying
integer argument to indicate how many of them are in the array.
The routine will overlay grid-tilings on these variables, generalizing
across values that differ by less than 1.0. </p>
    <p>The last two arguments are optional. For each different
value of the <code>num_ints</code> integers in <code>ints</code> the
tiles will be hashed totally differently, such that there
is no generalization to any other value of the integers. These
inputs are often used to ensure different hashings for
different groups of tilings, e.g., for different actions in
reinforcement learning.
There are some illustrative examples below.
Alternatively, if there are three such integers or less, they can be
provided as simple integer arguments to <code>GetTiles</code> (in
place of the
last two arguments as described above). These cases will be intercepted
by a specialized version of <code>GetTiles</code>, the integers packed
into an
array automatically, and finally the base version of <code>GetTiles</code>,
as described above, will be called. There is a similar shortcut for the
case
with one or two floating-point variables, described <a
 href="#Shortcuts">below</a>. </p>
    <p>Next we describe examples, gradually increasing in complexity,
of
the use of the tiles routine. </p>
    <hr><a name="Example"></a>
    <h2>Example: 32 4x4 Rectangular Grid-Tilings </h2>
In the simplest case, we form simple grid-like tilings. Suppose we are
interested
in the unit square over two real variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. We
wish to tile it into 4x4 tilings (i.e.,
each
tile
is .25 by .25). This will create the possibility of generalization
between any two input vectors in which both components are within .25
of each other. <code>GetTiles</code>
assumes unit generalization in its inputs, so we arrange for .25
generalization by scaling <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and stuffing the
results into a float array <code>float_array</code>
to be input to tiles:
    <pre><code><br>float float_array[2];<br><br>float_array[0] = x / 0.25;<br>float_array[1] = y / 0.25;<br></code></pre>
    <p>Despite this fairly
broad generalization, we would like the ability to make fine
distinctions if required.
For this we need many tilings, say 32 (a power of two is good here).
This will give us an ultimate resolution of .25/32=.0078, or better
than 1%.
To arrange for this we pass the tiles routine an integer array, <code>tiles_array</code>,
of at least 32 elements, to hold the returned
results, and pass 32 as the <code>num_tilings</code> argument. </p>
    <pre><code><br>int tiles_array[32];<br></code></pre>
    <p>Finally, we have to select <code>memory_size</code>, the range
of tile indices that will be hashed down into. First we consider the
"natural" memory size, as if we were doing no hashing. This is simply
the total number of tiles in all the tilings,
or 4*4*32=512 in our case. This is not a large number and might be used
directly as the <code>memory_size</code>.
Note, however, that this does not mean there will be no hashing or hash
collisions.
This routine always hashes and so collisions are possible. You could
make them very unlikely
by using a large memory size, say 5120, or even 512000 if you have
enough memory for
how the tiles are to be used. More often the natural memory size is too
large, say 10^10, and we must hash into a smaller memory size. </p>
    <p>Thus, our final call to <code>GetTiles</code> routine might be </p>
    <pre><code><br>GetTiles(tiles_array,32,512,float_array,2);<br></code></pre>
    <p>The returned tiles can be used in many ways, as is discussed <a
 href="http://richsutton.com/book/8/node1.html">elsewhere</a>. But let
us complete this simple example by showing one use. To do simple linear
function approximation
one uses an array of weights of number equal to the total number of
possible tiles
(<code>memory_size</code>).
The approximate function value for the input vector of real values is
obtained
simply by summing the weights of the corresponding returned tiles: </p>
    <pre><code><br>float weights[512];<br><br>float result=0.0;<br>for (i=0;i&lt;32;i++) result += weights[tiles_array[i]];<br></code></pre>
Finally, for learning, assume we have a value <code>target</code> that
we wish to adjust the approximation result towards:
    <pre><code><br>float target;<br>float alpha=0.1;  // step-size parameter<br><br>for (i=0;i&lt;32;i++) weight[tiles_array[i]] += alpha/32 * (target - result);<br></code></pre>
    <hr>
    <h2><a name="Shortcuts"></a> Shortcuts for 1 or 2 Floating-Point
Variables </h2>
    <p>For simple uses of <code>GetTiles</code>, packing into arrays
is
tiresome,
so we provide routines to do the packing for you for the cases
with 1 or 2 floating-point state variables, called <code>GetTiles1</code>
and <code>GetTiles2</code>.
For example, the 4x4 grid case described above could be done without
explicitly
packing into the <code>float_array</code> by calling </p>
    <pre><code><br>GetTiles2(tiles_array,32,512,x/.25,y/.25);<br></code></pre>
    <hr>
    <h2><a name="Simple Variations"></a> Simple (Single-Call)
Variations </h2>
    <p>There are a number of useful simple variations on the example
described
above.
Obviously, one could scale the two dimensions differently to get
rectangular
rather than square tiles. One could also stretch and distort the
dimensions, for example,
making one logarithmic. Or one could obtain a rotated grid by linear
transformations
on the original <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> variables. For example, to get
a grid oriented along the diagonals, we construct the <code>float_array</code>
like this: </p>
    <pre><code><br>float_array[0] = (x+y) / 0.25;<br>float_array[1] = (x-y) / 0.25;<br></code></pre>
    <p>Note that the tiling produced in all these cases is not
restricted to
any region of
the space. It extends in all directions to infinity; it is a tiling of
the infinite
plane. These infinite number of tiles are reduced to <code>memory_size</code>
in number
by the hashing. </p>
    <p>If you want to restrict the input vector to a limited region,
then
you must do so
yourself before calling <code>GetTiles</code>. If you want to achieve
a wrap-around
effect, then you should cause wrap-around when you construct the <code>float_array</code>,
e.g., by dividing by the width of the region and filling <code>float_array</code>
with the remainder. </p>
    <hr><a name="Complex Variations"></a>
    <h2>Complex (Multiple-Call) Variations </h2>
    <p>Sometimes one can get by with a single kind of tiling, as
produced by a
single call
to <code>GetTiles</code> (note that a single call creates multiple
tillings, but these are
all simple offset copies of each other). But for many other cases one
needs to be a little more sophisticated.
A great deal can be done to control the generalization and to limit the
memory requirements
by using multiple tilings through multiple calls to <code>GetTiles</code>.
We consider some of
these below. </p>
    <p>Suppose as previously you have input vectors in the unit square,
but
you want to generalize
between input vectors that are similar along the <i>x</i> dimension OR
similar along the <i>y</i>
dimension. To do this you need <i>two</i> kinds of tilings, one
producing stripes horizontally and one vertically. Suppose you want to
make 32 tilings of each type, and combine the results
in one 64-element <code>tiles_array</code>: </p>
    <pre><code><br>int tiles_array[64];<br><br>GetTiles1(tiles_array,32,4*32*2,x/0.25,0);<br>GetTiles1(&amp;tiles_array[32],32,4*32*2,y/0.25,1);<br></code></pre>
The second call to <code>GetTiles</code> passes in, in effect, the
second half of the full <code>tiles_array</code>. The tiles from the
second group of tilings will go there. Notice that the <code>memory_size</code>
input
is the same for both calls and set roughly equal to the memory
requirements for <i>both</i>
sets of tiles: 4 (stripes over the unit interval) * 32 (number of
tilings within a stripe) * 2
(because there are two sets of tilings over this memory space). As
always, the <code>memory_size</code> can be chosen within wide limits,
but it makes sense to chose it the same for all the groups of
tilings. Finally, notice that we change the final
integer input from 0 to 1 in the second call. Whenever using multiple
calls like this, it is a good idea to give them each a different
setting for the integer arguments.
    <p>There are a lot of possibilities here. One could use two groups
of
tilings, one for each single dimension, as illustrated above, PLUS an
additional group of tilings that depends on both dimensions. This would
create a system that generalizes partly along each dimension
separately, but also on the two dimensions conjunctively, so that it
could if needed
learn to give a special response to a particular <i>pair</i> of <i>x,y</i>
values.
Another possibility would be to choose some groups of tilings with
coarse generalization and
some with fine. </p>
    <p>One can control the tendency to generalize in the different ways
given by each group of tilings by controlling the number of tilings in
each group. For example, if you wanted
discrimination to be stronger along <i>x</i> rather than <i>y</i>,
then you would ask for more <i>x</i> tillings
(more than 32) in the above example, or fewer <i>y</i> tilings. </p>
    <hr><a name="Consistent Hashing"></a>
    <h2>Getting Consistent Hashing </h2>
    <p>In many applications one wants to make sure hashing, a random
process,
is done
in a consistent way. The hashing done by the routines described here is
determined
by some tables filled with random numbers the first time the routine is
called. To get consistent hashing you need only ensure that the random
number generator is in a consistent state for the first call. A
convenient way to do this is
to make a dummy first call during an initialization portion of your
program. For example, an early portion of your C++ code could include: </p>
    <pre><code><br>int dummy_tiles[1];<br>float dummy_vars[1];<br><br>srand(0);<br>GetTiles(dummy_tiles,1,1,dummy_vars,0);<br></code></pre>
In lisp, you would use an implementation-dependent procedure to set <code>*random-state*</code>
in
a reproducable manner, then call <code>(get-tiles nil 1 1)</code>.
    <hr><a name="Lisp Versions"></a>
    <h2>Lisp Versions </h2>
    <p>The LISP function "<code>get-tiles</code>" returns a list of
tile
indices. It is called as follows: </p>
    <pre><code><br>(get-tiles                   <br>   num-tilings             ; the number of tilings desired<br>   memory-size             ; the number of possible tile indices<br>   floats                  ; a list of real values making up the input vector<br>   ints)                   ; optional list of integers to get different hashings<br></code></pre>
All the inputs have the same meanings and uses as described above.
Multiple calls
are combined by appending (or nconcing) the resultant lists into one
list.
    <p>The function "<code>load-tiles</code>" is also available as a
maximally efficient interface.
It loads a portion of a provided array with the returned tile indices.
It is called as follows: </p>
    <pre><code><br>(load-tiles<br>   tiles                   ; a provided array for the tile indices to go into<br>   starting-element        ; first element of "tiles" to be changed (typically 0)<br>   num-tilings             ; the number of tilings desired<br>   memory-size             ; the number of possible tile indices<br>   floats                  ; a list of real values making up the input vector<br>   ints)                   ; list of optional inputs to get different hashings<br></code></pre>
    <hr> <a name="Python Versions"></a>
    <h2>Python Versions </h2>
Python versions exist but are still experimental. The following is
provisional documentation, based on the lisp model.
    <p>The Python function "<code>getTiles</code>" returns a tuple of
tile
indices. It is called as follows: </p>
    <pre><code><br>getTiles(numTilings, memorySize, floats, ints)<br></code></pre>
All the inputs have the same meanings and uses as described above.
Multiple calls
are combined by concatenating the resultant tuples into one.
    <p>The function "<code>loadTiles</code>" is also available as a
maximally efficient interface.
It loads a portion of a provided array with the returned tile indices.
It is called as follows: </p>
    <pre><code><br>loadTiles(tiles, startingElement, numTilings, memorySize, floats, ints)<br></code></pre>
with meanings as in the lisp calls.
    <hr><a name="Safe Versions"></a>
    <h2>Safe Versions </h2>
    <p>With the code described so far, there is a small probability
that
unrelated inputs
will hash into some of the same tiles. In a group of tilings, usually
there will be no
more than one such "collision", so that it is not a big problem; the
learning
process will sort it out. There will not be a big effect on performance
unless
the memory is too small or the hash functions are poorly designed.
Nevertheless, the possibility of such a problem is annoying. When one's
program doesn't work, there is a tendency, deserved or not, to suspect
a failure of the hashing function. </p>
    <p>To alleviate this kind of concern, we provide another "safe"
version
of the routine that
does the additional work to prevent hashing collisions -- or rather to
detect them and
take the necessary corrective steps. The result is a guaranteed exact
emulation
of the infinite tilings. Every different tile used will have a
different index. If more tiles are used than there is space within the <code>memory_size</code>,
then an error
is signaled. Of course there is also a cost in terms of additional
memory and computation. </p>
    <p>The additional memory is contained in an additional data
structure,
called a "collision
table". To create and use a collision table in the original 4x4
example: </p>
    <pre><code><br>collision_table ct(512,1);<br>float float_array[2];<br>int tiles_array[32];<br><br>float_array[0] = x / 0.25;<br>float_array[1] = y / 0.25;<br>GetTiles(tiles_array,32,&amp;ct,float_array,2);<br></code></pre>
In the declaration of the collision table, the 512 is the size of the
table. The size must be a power of two. The 1 in the declaration
indicates that this is to be a "safe" table; provide a 0 here if you
just
want to collect statistics on a regular table. Notice that the
collision
table is then used in place of the <code>memory_size</code> in calls
to <code>GetTiles</code>.
This is possible because of course the collision table has the <code>memory_size</code>
stored within it.
    <p>You can call <code>ct.usage()</code> to determine how many
entries
in the table
are currently in use. You can also examine <code>ct.calls</code>, <code>ct.clearhits</code>,
and <code>ct.collisions</code> to determine the number of times this
collision
table has been used (calls), has returned a result without a collision
(clearhits),
and has had collisions (collisions, which may be more than one per
call). </p>
    <p><code>ct.reset</code> clears the collision table, making room
for a
new set of entries. </p>
    <p>In Lisp, you construct a collision-table by calling <code>make-ct</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code><br>(make-ct  <br>   memory-size             ; the number of possible tile indices<br>   safety-level)           ; one of :safe, :unsafe, or :super-safe<br></code></pre>
    <p>which returns the newly initialized collision-table.
The <code>memory-size</code> here must be a power of two, e.g., 1024;
otherwise it is
the same <code>memory-size</code> as before. If the <code>safety-level</code>
is <code>:unsafe</code>, then
the collision table is used only to collect statistics; collisions are
still allowed
and not corrected for. Normally, a <code>safety-level</code> of <code>:safe</code>
is adequate, but <code>:super-safe</code> is available to be
absolutely sure. </p>
    <p>Once a collision table has been constructed, it is used in any
of
the routines
previously described simply by passing it in in place of the <code>memory-size</code>
input to the routine. For example, a lisp version of the 32 4x4 tilings
    <a href="#Example">example</a>, using the safe version, would look
like
this: </p>
    <pre><code><br>(setq ctable (make-ct 512 :safe))                    ; this is done once<br><br>(get-tiles 32 ctable (list (/ x .25) (/ y .25)))     ; this is done for each x,y<br></code></pre>
    <p>In Python, you obtain a CollisionTable by calling <code>CollisionTable(memorySize,
safetyLevel)</code>, with meanings as above except <code>safetyLevel</code>
is one of 'safe', 'unsafe', or 'superSafe'.
Once a collision table has been constructed, it is used in any of the
routines
previously described simply by passing it in in place of the <code>memorySize</code>
input to the routine. For example, a python version of the 32 4x4
tilings <a href="#Example">example</a>, using the safe version, would
look like this: </p>
    <pre><code><br>ctable = CollisionTable(512, 'safe')                  # this is done once<br><br>getTiles(32, ctable, (x/.25, y/.25))                  # this is done for each x,y<br></code></pre>
    <hr> <br>
    <h2> <a name="Wrap-around Versions"></a>Wrap-around Versions </h2>
    <p>The tilings we have discussed so far stretch out to infinity
with no
need to specify a range for them. This is cool, but sometimes not what
you want. Sometimes you want the variables to wrap-around over some
range. For example, you may have an angle variable that goes from 0 to
2pi and then should wrap around, that is, you would like generalization
to occur between angles just greater than 0 and angles that are nearly
2pi. To accomodate this, we provide some alternative, wrap-around
versions of the tiling routines. </p>
    <p>These versions take an additional input, <code>wrap-widths</code>,
which parallels the float structure (array or list), and which
specifies for each float the width of the range over which it wraps
(e.g., 2pi). If you don't want a float to wrap, it's wrap-width should
be zero (in LISP, nil). The wrapping width is in the same units as the
floats, but should be an integer. Specifying the complete range of
wrapping (rather than just the width) is not necessary for the same
reason we did not need to give a range at all in the previous routines.
    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you wanted to cover the 2pi x 3 rectangular
area with 16 tilings, each with a width of generalization one-tenth of
the space in each dimension, and with wrap-around in the first
dimension but not the second. In C you would do </p>
    <pre><code><br>int tiles_array[16];<br><br>float float_array[2];<br>int wrap_array[2];<br><br>float_array[0] = x / (3 * 0.1);<br>wrap_array[0] = 0;<br><br>float_array[1] = y / (2 * 3.14159 * 0.1);<br>wrap_array[1] = 10;<br><br>GetTilesWrap(tiles_array,16,512,float_array,2,wrap_array);<br></code></pre>
where <code>GetTilesWrap</code> has the interface:
    <pre><code><br>void GetTilesWrap(<br>    int tiles[],           // provided array will contain the returned tile indices<br>    int num_tilings,       // number of tile indices to be returned<br>    int memory_size,       // total number of possible tiles<br>    float floats[],        // array of floating-point vars to be converted to tiles<br>    int num_floats,        // number of floating-point variables<br>    int wrap_widths[],     // array of widths (length and units as in floats)<br>    int ints[],            // array of integer variables to be converted to tiles<br>    int num_ints)          // number of integer variables<br></code></pre>
    <p>There is a known bug in the C version - because of an oddity of
the C
mod function the results are very slightly off as inputs cross zero. </p>
    <p>In LISP, the wrapping routines are: </p>
    <pre><code><br>(get-tiles-wrap                   <br>   num-tilings             ; the number of tilings desired<br>   memory-size             ; the number of possible tile indices<br>   floats                  ; a list of real values making up the input vector<br>   wrap-widths             ; list of widths for wrap-around on floats (ints or nil)<br>   ints)                   ; optional list of integers to get different hashings<br></code></pre>
and
    <pre><code><br>(load-tiles-wrap  <br>   tiles                   ; a provided array for the tile indices to go into<br>   starting-element        ; first element of "tiles" to be changed (typically 0)<br>   num-tilings             ; the number of tilings desired<br>   memory-size             ; the number of possible tile indices<br>   floats                  ; a list of real values making up the input vector<br>   wrap-widths             ; list of widths for wrap-around on floats (ints or nil)<br>   ints)                   ; list of optional inputs to get different hashings<br></code></pre>
    <p>In Python, the wrapping routines are: </p>
    <pre><code><br>getTilesWrap(numTilings, memorySize, floats, wrapWidths, ints)<br></code></pre>
and
    <pre><code><br>loadTilesWrap(tiles, startingElement, numTilings, memorySize, floats, \\<br><br>wrapWidths, ints)<br></code></pre>
